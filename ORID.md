O: I learnt TDD today, and completed a few exercises on generateMultiplicationTable program and MarsRover program. By doing TDD, 
we break down the program into smaller runnable and verifiable units. 

R: I think TDD can help us to run and try the program in earlier stage instead of fully completing the program. 
By doing so, I can prevent overestimating my progress as I can identify problems in time during trial runs.

I: Thus, TDD is a powerful tool for developing programs, especially for complicated requirements. 

D: I will be using TDD for my requirements when I come back to work. This might induce more workload in the early stage
of development as I have to prepare test cases in addition to the program itself. However, I believe this will help me 
to identify and fix problems in time. This benefit will offset and exceed the time cost of adopting TDD.
